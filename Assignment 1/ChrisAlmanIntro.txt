Hello, my name is Christopher Alman. I married my wife jennifer in 2008 and we have three children, my youngest zachary is 13, Haylie is 14, and the oldest Lydia is 19. For the last 13 years i have worked as a journeyman tool and die maker with a primary work load of prototype aluminum auto parts. Prior to my current position i proudly served in the United States Marine Corps from September 2004 - September 2008. During my time in service i completed two tours overseas although i would have gladly gone again if not for my wife letting me know i was done. Apparently she was tired of me getting injured, Lol. Tool and die is an amazing field to work in as vehicles are always changing, unfortunatly with technology advancing as it has in the last decade, my job is slowly being fased out as machining programs and tooling are no longer requiring human interaction. This is what sparked the thought of going back to school for a degree in computer science, after all when a robot is going to take your job the why not learn to program the robot. This semester i am enrolled in CPS-298 and CPS-276 and upon completion will graduate. I will admit while i find all of this very interesting and enjoy every aspect of it, i find myself lost as i am so used to being a hands on worker.
